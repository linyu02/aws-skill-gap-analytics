# Skill Gap Analytics (AWS + LLM)

I thought I needed to learn everything—so I built a system to find what actually matters.

Built with AWS serverless + LLMs, this pipeline extracts, aggregates, and analyzes job market demand to guide learning decisions.

## 💡 Why I Built This

Job descriptions made it feel like:
> “I need to learn everything.”

So I treated the job market like a dataset and asked:

> **Which skills actually matter across the roles I care about?**

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- The market is **more structured than it feels**  
- A small set of skills shows up **consistently across roles**  
- ~30% of top skills are **soft skills**; **communication appears in ~90%**  
- My resume already covered **~85% of demand**  

👉 The problem wasn’t “learn everything” —  
it was **identify high-leverage gaps + communicate existing skills better**

---

## What This System Does

- Extracts skills from job descriptions (LLM + evidence)  
- Tracks **weekly demand trends**  
- Compares market demand vs. resume  
- Outputs **targeted skill gaps + next steps**
